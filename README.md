# Transfer-learning-with-the-MaskRCNN-model-pre-trained-on-the-COCO-dataset
This code example demonstrates the use of transfer learning with the Mask R-CNN model pre-trained on the COCO dataset to perform object detection on a random image. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

It starts by setting up the TensorFlow and NumPy environments.

It installs specific versions of TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

It clones the Mask R-CNN GitHub repository for access to the Mask R-CNN implementation.

The code imports the necessary libraries, including Mask R-CNN, and configures the project's root directory.

It specifies the directory to save logs and trained models (MODEL_DIR) and the path to the pre-trained COCO weights (COCO_MODEL_PATH).

The COCO pre-trained weights are downloaded if they don't already exist.

It sets up the configuration for inference, including specifying GPU settings and batch size.

It creates a Mask R-CNN model for inference mode and loads the pre-trained COCO weights.

A list of class names corresponding to COCO classes is defined.

A random image is loaded from the "images" directory.

The model is used to detect objects in the loaded image.

The results of the detection are visualized, including bounding boxes, masks, class labels, and confidence scores.

This code demonstrates the entire process of using a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to perform object detection on a random image using the COCO dataset classes. It serves as a practical example of transfer learning for object detection.
